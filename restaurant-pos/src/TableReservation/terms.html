                    Unless we specifically refer to a "refundable deposit",
                    we do NOT charge anything to the credit card unless there is a "no show"
                    of which we have no prior notice. Refundable deposits are credited in full
                    to your account balance on payment on departure. By making a reservation
                    with us and providing contact details you are "opting in" to our marketing
                    programme. If you do not wish to receive marketing material from ourselves 
                    please email the contact address on the email we send you with "Unsubscribe"
